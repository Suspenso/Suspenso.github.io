      <h1>Info</h1>
      <p>My name is J.J. Guti√©rrez, and I live in Puerto Rico at the moment. I earned a B.A. in Communications, but my 
      interests are far greater than just that field. I been trying to teach myself coding thru Codecademy in an effort 
      to expand my knowledge into a more scientific field. At this time the page is meant for my to practice some HTML, 
      CSS, jQuery coding (maybe some more in the future). I have a basic understanding of this languages, and a bit of
      Python and JavaScript. Right now, I'm looking for a good place to practice, expand, or develop new skill thru job, 
      volunteer, or internship. On my downtime I enjoy the simple things in life. Riding motorcycles, watching movies, 
      taking pictures, and reading online/offline.</p>
