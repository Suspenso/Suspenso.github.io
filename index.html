      <p>My name is J.J. Guti√©rrez, and I live in Puerto Rico at the moment. I earned a B.A. in Communications, but my 
      interests are far greater than just that field. I been trying to teach myself coding thru Codecademy in an effort 
      to expand my knowledge into a more scientific field. At this time the page is meant for my to practice some HTML, 
      CSS, jQuery coding (maybe some more in the future).</p>
